# 卡诺

卡诺刚刚成为工程兵军官时，就发表了《数学论文集》，这为他赢得了加入许多学术团体的机会。之后，他创作了一首关于沃邦的赞美诗，并获得了第戎学院的奖项。大革命开始时，他是工兵上尉，并被提名为圣路易骑士。1791年，他当选为加莱海峡省立法议会议员。他在那里发表的第一篇演说针对的是移民到科布伦茨的王公、米拉波、红衣主教罗汉和德-卡隆纳先生，他们在外国宫廷阴谋策划战争，企图毁灭法国。他建议用准尉和军士取代出国的贵族军官。1792年，他要求拆除法国内陆的所有堡垒，并采取必要措施废除士兵和军官自动和被动服从的做法。他下令制造 30 万支长矛，用来武装全国。他让立法议会解散了国民自卫军，因为他们极度缺乏爱国精神。1792年9月，他被提名为国民公会代表，投票赞成立即处死国王。他将摩纳哥公国和比利时的一部分并入法国。1792年，他被派往北方军队，在瓦蒂尼（Wattignies）战场上，他解除了格拉蒂昂（Gratien）将军的职务，因为他在敌人面前逃跑了，并让自己担任进攻纵队的首领。之后，在1793年8月，他被提名为公共安全委员会成员，同时被提名的还有他的朋友和共同爱国者，来自科多尔（Cote-d'Or）的普里厄（Prieur），他和他一样都是工兵上尉。如果没有他们，非军人出身的委员会其他成员就不可能组织起全面防御，也不可能将入侵法国的外国军队赶出法国领土。

随后，卡诺与负责军队装备和武器、枪支、军刀、大炮等大型制造的科多尔（Cote-d'Or）的普里厄（Prieur）合作，在组织十四支军队、制定联合作战的作战计划以及各支军队的作战计划方面展现出了巨大的能力。卡诺成功地利用这些军队取得了令人惊叹的胜利，从夺回土伦到攻克北方的四个要塞。

在国民公会中反动精神占上风并威胁到公共安全委员会老成员的危险时刻，卡诺来到了律师界，要求与他的同僚们同呼吸共命运，因为他曾与他们一起奋斗过。

就在这时，最狂热的反动派之一、瓦兹河畔的布尔东（Bourdon）反对征求卡诺的意见，但同时又免去了对他的指责，他说："就是他组织了我们军队的胜利。尽管弗里龙、塔利安和巴拉斯激起了不可抗拒的反革命热情，国民公会还是采纳了卡诺的建议。

1796 年，他被任命为行政院议员，如果不是无知而自以为是的巴拉斯掌管战争部，他本可以在军事事件中发挥巨大的影响力。领导层分裂的时间并不长；卡诺和巴特勒米无力对抗巴拉斯和他的另外两位同事。

随后，在18日的暴力行动中，卡诺，这位伟大的工程师却不是一个出色的阴谋家，在卢森堡面临着被巴拉斯的流氓暗杀的危险；然而，他还来得及躲过这一懦弱的企图。五百人会议的法令判处他和其他保皇党人一样被押送到卡宴。

卡诺在瑞士避难，并在那里发表了一篇关于自己行为的文章。这部著作揭露了三位局长的丑行和可耻行径，促使人们推翻了这个在宪法和纯粹名义形式下推行的专制政府。

1800 年，第一执政波拿巴将卡诺召回法国，任命他为审查总长和陆军大臣。但这位野心勃勃的执政官无疑认为卡诺的思想过于民主，于是用贝尔蒂埃将军取代了他，而贝尔蒂埃将军更适合担任陆军少将而非陆军部长。

后来，卡诺被任命为法庭成员，他在发言中表现出了与在国民议会时同样灵活而严格的自由原则。他加入了反对领事政府专横计划的行列。

当波拿巴发现自己受到十年一次的立宪执政官制度的阻碍时，卡诺反对终身执政。他发表了非常有力的、而且是预言性的演说，反对让波拿巴称帝的想法；他预见到了与外国无休止的联盟，以及由英国政府资助的长期战争。为了国家和政府的利益，他希望第一执政拒绝接受皇帝这个无用而危险的头衔。他的这番话，加上护民官中最爱国、最开明的人的意见，在很大程度上促成了法庭的解散，因为法庭的权力已经与第一执政官暗地里的无限野心不可调和，他只想在行政管理中保持专制主义和尚武精神。

法庭解散后，卡诺退居幕后，只从事研究和冥想，直到皇帝认识到这位伟大的公民所受到的不公正待遇，才以前任大臣的身份向他发放抚恤金，并取消了他过去十年的俸禄。之后，皇帝邀请他撰写一篇关于要塞的论文，用于对将领和要塞长官进行高级指导。这部著作历经多个版本。

北方蛮族第一次入侵时，卡尔诺被任命为安特卫普总督。他精力充沛地抵御了联军的围攻，直到确信路易十八已被法国接见，而不是受到以军事身份占领巴黎的外国势力的影响时，他才撤离了安特卫普，正如他在发表的演说中所说的那样。

回到巴黎后，卡诺的军衔得到了确认，并继续服役。他重新获得了圣路易十字勋章，这是他在1789年大革命前就应得的。

路易十八向已经拥有国家宪法的法国授予特许状的形式令所有爱国者和开明人士不满。作为这一伟大的王权篡夺行为序言的论述只是确认了国王的权力；路易十八坚持认为这份宪章是一份礼物和让步，而不是他与国家之间的条约。这促使卡诺就这一问题向国王写了一份奏折，引起了巨大的轰动。

据说，卡诺写这份奏折的目的是让人们倾向于拿破仑的回归，而国王的谄媚者则把这份奏折说成是一种阴谋行为。

1815年3月，皇帝从厄尔巴岛回国后重新掌权，封卡诺为伯爵和法国贵族，并任命他为内政部长。在这个动荡的年代，没有人比卡诺表现得更尽心尽力了。

随后，警察总长福什（Fouche）在没有征求卡诺意见的情况下，印制了大量他给国王的奏折，并在街头免费散发。

在他的大臣通告中，卡诺对波旁王朝、教士、英国和盟国都一视同仁，对1814年的暴行和弊端也不放过。他继续以同样的爱国热情写作，直到滑铁卢的灾难突然改变了军事和政治的面貌。

6月21日，卡诺不得不在贵族院悲痛地讲述了滑铁卢战役的损失，并提供了最详尽的细节。

1815年7月24日的敕令是杜伊勒里宫的所有仆人和整个外交机构长期以来的顽固要求，其中包含两份流放者名单，一份由塔列朗签署，另一份由富尔什签署，这两个叛徒为了外国黄金出卖了拿破仑。卡诺被列入了38人名单。他被迫离开巴黎，起初在比利时避难，后来选择了华沙作为撤退地，但由于不信任沙皇亚历山大的保护，他去了普鲁士，并撤回马格德堡。他在华沙显然受到了极大的尊重，但却受到俄国政府警察的严密监视。虽然普鲁士人是法国最凶恶的敌人，但他在马格德堡的处境却比较轻松。

卡诺一直被视为一流的数学家和工程师中最博学、最能干的军官。

他发表了一篇关于一般机械的论文；一份关于法国军队的功绩和崇高事迹的清单；一些关于数学的著作；一些关于无穷小微积分形而上学的思考；一篇驳斥关于弗洛里多 18 日阴谋的报告；运动平衡的基本原理；投影几何； 反对在法国重建世袭君主制的演说；关于空间五点间距离关系的论述；关于横轴的论文；防御工事；1814 年的国王回忆录；关于卡诺中将自 1814 年 7 月 1 日起的政治行为的论述，等等。

普拉里亚尔三年（1795年）七月一日之后（1795年）之后，在保皇反动派灾难性的背信弃义的引导下，国民公会的几位成员英勇牺牲，他们是当之无愧的自由殉道者。罗姆姆（Romme）、古戎（Goujon）和苏布拉尼（Soubrany）是这出政治戏剧中的坚定演员，他们以自杀结束了自己的生命，这是他们唯一的办法，就像古时候贤德的加图一样。六位不公正的暴力集会的不幸牺牲者，死后仍然忠实于他们的公民伙伴关系，凛然不可侵犯，就像他们在争取自由的革命联合中一样。

在日耳曼第12日之前，卡诺个人被联合移民党和反动派出钱组织的骚乱所驱逐，他以非凡的技巧为公共安全委员会的同僚们辩护，这些人注定要被任意押送和流放而不受审判。在一次法庭上听取我的辩护时，他高尚地、自愿地为委员会的行为承担责任，不管他们用什么手段把他和同事们分开。

在《奥里弗拉姆报》（Oriflamme）（1823年8月）之前，没有一家报纸不讴歌这位著名的军事家。这份报纸一致认为，卡诺将军博学多才，通晓战争艺术，并以其巧妙的构思和作品脱颖而出，我们的伟大领袖们将永远借鉴他的作品。事实上，对于伟大的军事家来说，卡诺的著作永远是丰富的教益。正是后人希望他的爱国功绩和卓越的军事才能得到应有的评价。当代人永远与后人无关。

Being a director with Barras, he could not put up with his vices and dishonesty, and this made them irreconcilable enemies.

He said of Madame de StaelHoist ein: "She is Ninon without her beauty, but with ambition in addition."

He said of Talleyrand: "He takes somewhat after Cardinal Richelieu, having his astuteness and duplicity, but not his genius."

He said of Bonaparte, as a general: "He will imitate Caesar; we shall see him ready to pass the Rubicon in case he should want to."

He said of Barras: "He had all the vices of the Regent, without one of his good qualities."

Copy of the letter addressed to the Emperor Napoleon by Carnot, offering his services at the time of the foreign invasion:

PARIS, January 24th, 1814.

SIRE, As long as success crowned your enterprises, I abstained from offering your Majesty services which I thought would not be agreeable. To-day, Sire, when bad fortune subjects your constancy to a great test, I do not hesitate to offer you such feeble means as remain to me. Possibly the strength of a sexagenarian's arm is not much, but I thought that the example of a soldier whose patriotic sentiments are well known might be the means of rallying to your standard many who are uncertain as to which side they ought to take, and who may be easily persuaded that they will better serve their country by abandoning that standard. There is yet time for you, Sire, to obtain a glorious peace and the love of a great nation.

(Signed) CARNOT.

The Emperor immediately appointed him Governor of Antwerp, Flushing, and the fortresses on this coast, reinstalling him in his rank of lieutenant-general.

A eulogium on Carnot was made by the learned M. Arago, of the Academy of Sciences, in a public meeting of the 2ist of August, 1837. The permanent secretary read this eulogium, which lasted nearly three hours, and which was many times applauded by the assembly.

Carnot took refuge in Warsaw in 1815. Being asked by the Poles what he thought of their constitution, given to them by Alexander I., who used to brag of his liberal ideas, he replied that a charter which was granted could scarcely be favourable to liberty.

This officer of the engineers and French patriot directed the operations and plans of campaign of the immortal armies of the Republic.

The defensive system of a country ought to be brought into keeping with (gradually, and by correcting little by little whatever is found insufficient and defective in military establishment) the views of government, the topography of the frontiers, and, finally, the march of science.

Vauban, who had the eye of an engineer, had organised the defensive system of the north and east of France by various styles of fortresses and on various lines. But the distribution of these places on a frontier so open and extended may change with the same motives as first determined their respective positions. To-day the number and sites of our points of defence have undergone the experiences of the long war of the Republic and the Empire; and, in spite of the works of Vauban, the energy of the artillery and engineers, and, above all, the courage of Frenchmen, the Empire has undergone two invasions, one after another.

As to the number and nature of these points of defence, the opinion of the greatest generals has always been that it is better to have few fortresses, but that they should be large, well ordered and well armed, like those of Strasburg and Lille in France, Maestricht in Holland, Namur and Antwerp in Belgium, Magdeburg and Dantzig in Prussia, Luxemburg in German territory, Ulm in Bavaria, and Mantua in Italy, etc.

A great number of indifferent places are in themselves very weak or too neglected on account of their number. Small garrisons scattered about in this way weaken the main army and do not stop the enemy, who is quite content to march forward, leaving small detachments to surround these small places until want of provisions causes them to yield one after another without striking a blow. Then it makes use of them as supports and centres for attacking the stronger fortresses.

The suppression of these small places, whose positions render them quite unnecessary (such as Landau, Marienburg, and Philippeville in the north of France, and Huningen in the east), would be of value to the frontier defences; and the government might keep the sums annually spent in keeping them up for putting the chief fortresses into a state of formidable defence. The latter, supported by the vicinity of the active army, are very difficult to blockade, and also difficult to take; whilst the enemy would not dare to leave them behind for fear of having all their means of communication cut off.

The small places, though abandoned as points of defence, need not be demolished. They might serve as close towns to shelter light troops and detachments which had not an accompaniment of artillery. The inhabitants of the country round could withdraw to them, in case of urgent need, with their provisions, principal effects, and families.

As to the defence of fortresses of which the maximum resistance has been calculated at forty days in a regular attack, it is summed up in the two words, valour and industry. They ought to act in concert to be efficient, and never to cease from affording one another mutual support.

If it becomes necessary in the nineteenth century to establish a new system of general defence for the frontiers of France, it will be done differently to that which exists at present, as much as regards the disposition of the fortresses as their number and the plan of each of them. Variation of the frontiers as the result of war and treaties of peace, naturally calls for changes in the arrangement of the fortified posts.

The line of fortresses which extend along a frontier may also be found to be established the wrong way about, and it becomes necessary to alter or change it.

Vauban neglected nothing in the science of fortifications; he put forward the principle which has given his method such a marked superiority in his summary, entitled, "General Maxims of Attack." He was writing for the besieging party then. His fundamental principle is that the besiegers should always, as long as they can, gain the points they wish to occupy step by step, and not by force. From which it follows, on the contrary, that the aim of the besieged should be not to let the enemy take anything from him except by main force. The besieged should never lose sight of this truth, which should direct all their defence operations. Vauban had not as much occasion to study the principles of defence as he had those of attack.

Vauban's great art in constructing fortified places consisted in profiting by local circumstances or the accidental advantage of the ground; and officers in the engineers will find it very useful to study what he says concerning the particular properties of each situation, which may turn out to be of great advantage when one knows how to discover them and profit by them. For example, if a town happens to be divided into two parts by a river it is an accident from which several advantages can be derived.

A kind of equilibrium existed between attack and defence until the seventeenth century, when the genius of Vauban suddenly turned the scale in favour of the science of attack. Indeed, people were so astonished at the successive fall and overthrow of places which till then had been renowned, that they did not dare to defend them, or, in other words, did not think of defending them. It was thought possible to yield without dishonour to such an ascendency; and thus came into use that now trivial maxim, "There is no place which is impregnable." This doleful maxim ought never to have been uttered by a military man endowed with the confidence of the government, and by a chief to whose fidelity it had trusted one of the keys of France.

Carnot has changed this state of things and these opinions. I transcribe the remarkable conclusion of his work on "The Defence of Strong Places" (page 476 of the second edition), published at Paris in 1811.

"The result of the work which has just been read is evidently this soothing reflection: that the barriers of France are absolutely impregnable against any power or union of powers whatsoever, provided they be properly defended; that a good garrison, established in one of our present fortresses, and animated with a noble desire to distinguish themselves by a memorable defence, can, as long as they can find means of subsistence and ammunition, hold their own against an army ten times as numerous, and finally disappoint and utterly destroy it, if the latter is resolved upon overcoming the resistance."

It is quite certain that war is not carried on with the same ferocity and destruction as before the establishment of a system of fortified places. It is asserted that war has assumed, even amid its devastation, the character of a species of moderation, since civilised nations are provided against the incursions of barbarians by a cordon of points of defence and fortified places. Without it the west and south of Europe would still be exposed to Tartar wars and disturbances similar to those of the Huns, Suebi, Goths, and Vandals. Not only in Europe and in modern times are people defended in this way. Did not the Chinese Empire raise the Great Wall to protect itself from the Tartars and Mongols? Did not the Romans, who were so strong and warlike, under the Emperors Hadrian and Septimus Severus construct walls in Great Britain to separate the conquered province from the country of the Picts? History teaches us that our ancestors defended their strongholds for whole years. It is true they had a mother country and they fulfilled their duties towards her.

When the National Convention had appointed the chief members of the Committee of Public Safety in the month of January, 1793, Barere, who was one of them, was not long in pointing out in a committee which did not contain a single military man the insufficiency of the means of general defence. He proposed to include before anyone else Carnot and Prieur of the Cote-d'Or, both distinguished officers in the engineers and equally devoted to their country, and to put them in charge of the War Office. Carnot and Prieur accepted this honourable and responsible position, and Barere obtained the sanction of the Convention to their being added to the committee. From that time the general defence assumed an aspect of great activity, harmony, and energy, which alone were able to utilise the immense forces which the nation unceasingly put at the disposal of the National Assembly.

From morning till evening, and often far into the night did Carnot unceasingly work at the War Office in organising armies and preparing plans of campaign to stop the foreign invasions which had been commenced on all the more outlying parts of French territory. Whilst Prieur was having guns, cannon, arms of all sorts, powder, and saltpetre manufactured, Lindet was actively and earnestly occupied in providing provisions and clothing, and all the other materials for war and for the interior. It is impossible to have a just conception in time of peace, or even in ordinary wars, of the immense works and numerous innovations which Carnot had to make in directing, organising, and overlooking the progress of operations of fourteen armies, to give them faithful and enlightened leaders, to overcome the resistance and jealousy of certain generals, and to offer battle at the right moment, as at Dunkirk, Wattingen, Maubeuge, Toulon, and Fleurus.

In the intervals for meals, his only moments of relaxation, Carnot retired to the bosom of his family, returning to the committee from eight o'clock until one, two, or three o'clock in the morning. Having set in order the work of his office, he was present at the deliberations of the committee, and still occupied himself with the needs of France and the progress of national defence.

In the month of Germinal, 1794, at the time of the death of Danton, Carnot gave an account of the public opinion which he had witnessed on this sad occasion to the committee, and he proposed that the committee should henceforth oppose the accusation of members of the National Convention, in the interests even of representative government, which he regarded as destroyed if the servile and ardent passions of party spirit could overrule the representation. This resolution, which had become necessary on account of the grave events brought about by a few ambitious politicians who did not dare as yet to openly avow themselves, was carried unanimously in the absence of Robespierre, Saint-Just, and Couthon, who were not very assiduous in their attendance at the committee.

The latter owed Carnot a grudge, and went so far as to threaten to denounce him to the Convention as an aristocrat who was endeavouring to form a party in the army. Carnot only replied with indignant silence and deep sadness. Barere not being able to put up with the sight of such injustice and ingratitude towards the most hard-working, enlightened, and most essential man of the Committee, made a vehement address, in which he briefly recalled the great services Carnot had rendered in the public cause, from the day when he personally executed his plan of campaign for relieving Maubeuge, and conquering General Coburg at Wattingen, until the time when he planned and organised the clever and decisive battle of Fleurus. He demonstrated how the indefatigable Carnot had worked for liberty and his country without intrigues, useless speeches, ambition, and, above all, without reservation; and turning towards his unjust accusers exclaimed, "You are not unmindful that I also can make reports? Well! on the day you attack Carnot, I shall be in the tribune, and the National Convention shall hear me; it will declare itself unanimously in favour of the modest and courageous representative to whom we owe so many victories and the guidance of heroism in our soldiers."

This finished this sitting, as disgraceful as it was foolish. Saint-Just dared not approach the tribune, and Carnot was not accused.

Carnot regarded defensive war as the only natural and lawful kind. He considered offensive war only as an accidental circumstance, and only tolerated it as a preventive necessity or sequence to the defence of territory.

It was Carnot who, being indignant at the conduct of the English at the siege of Valenciennes, proposed a terrible measure to the Committee, but one which pointed them out as the bitterest enemies of France, everywhere pursuing liberty as a rival and an enemy. He proposed to declare that the Republican armies should make no English prisoners. Barere drew up a report which preceded the formal decree of the National Convention; but this decree was only cornminatory, for after the commencement of the battle the English suddenly deserted their lines and disappeared.

It was Carnot also who, to hasten the recapture of the four strongholds on the northern frontier, proposed to declare that the garrisons of these four places, who would not surrender, should be put to the sword. This resolution was decreed on the report of Barere, and although purely comminatory it produced the expected effect. The four northern strongholds were suddenly evacuated by the allies, and French territory was completely freed from them by the end of August, 1794.

When France was victorious she became the object of the ambition of, and a prey to, a few intriguers in the Convention, who had for a long time been illdisposed towards her. To get possession of power to it was only necessary to get rid of those who had exercised it to the advantage of the country; and it was only a question of accusing them. Denunciators are never wanting in France. The fanatic townspeople of Versailles were influenced, and Lecointre was charged by Tallien, Freron, and Barras with being the informer of the members of the Committee of Public Safety.

They wished at first to follow this up by accusing Carnot like the other members; but the Convention respected the man who had organised victory. Carnot had too proud a spirit, and was too just, to accept for himself an exception to the general denunciation. He loudly declared that he had taken part in the acts of the Committee of Public Safety, and that he accepted the responsibility of them. This high-souled proceeding astonished the corrupt accusers, who then had to sort out their accused so as to make their proscription less difficult.

When Carnot was appointed a director, he continued to direct the plan of campaign of the army in Italy, which was commanded by General Bonaparte, who knew his exceptional military talent; but Barras, who was the secret agent of Louis XVIII., having a majority in the directorate, ceaselessly opposed Carnot, and even threatened his life with his base guards of the Luxembourg. Carnot escaped from them and took refuge in Switzerland until the i8th of Brumaire, when Barras and his plots were thrown to the ground.

In 1800 he was Minister for War under the Consulate. Having become a member of the Tribunate, he opposed the establishment of the Empire, and gave the political reasons for his opposition, which Bonaparte only too well bore out by his wars.

However, Napoleon, hearing that Carnot with his family was in misfortune, granted him a pension as a retired minister of the government. Under the Empire, obedient to the wish of Napoleon, he composed, for the instruction of the general officers of the army, his "Defence of Fortresses." He afterwards went to defend the citadel of Antwerp against the army of the allies. Having returned to Paris, he addressed a memorial to the King, which was widely and successfully distributed among all classes of society. The Restoration was deaf and blind, and the memorial to the King consequently fruitless.

Then, on the return from the Isle of Elba, Carnot was appointed Minister of the Interior. There he found, in official succession to the Abbe Montesquieu, a general secretary named Guizot. The new minister was so discontented with the spirit and reports of M. Guizot that he dismissed him from his place as general secretary. The latter retired immediately to Ghent, to be with Louis XVIII., who had emigrated for the second time.

The character of Carnot was thoughtful, studious, and moral, and disposed to seclusion and the domestic fireside. He cultivated poetry as a relaxation from his military studies. He was accustomed to persistent work and solitary walks, and regarded being incorruptible rather as a severe duty than as a civic virtue.

Being again banished by the royal ordinance of Louis XVIII. in 1815, and by the amnesty law of the chamber of 1816, Carnot at first went to Warsaw, forgetting that a defender of liberty could not exist under the government of a Muscovite Czar. Soon after he withdrew to the neighbourhood of Magdeburg. A large fortified place was still the subject of his observation and study. He died in 1823, honoured by the Prussians, whom he had fought against, and forgotten by the Frenchmen, whom he had made victorious.
